function x = mygmres(I,b,x0,n,M,A)
% function that runs the GMRES algorithm for the problem Ax = b
% Inputs: I: number of iterations, x0: initial guess, n is the dimension of
% the problem, A is an n x n matrix, M is an n x n matrix used to define
% the norms
% output: x is the approximate solution to the problem Ax=b
